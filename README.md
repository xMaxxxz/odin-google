This is a project from The Odin Project's Web Development curriculum, more information available at: https://www.theodinproject.com.

I'll attempt to recreate the Google homepage and a results page. The aim of this project, however, isn't creating a functional search engine, but rather a cardboard recreation, if you will. Any further changing to the project's details will be added down below.

This project was finished without much trouble, the only difficulties being making the searchbar 'pop out' when hovered over (I could only sort of replicate it by adding shadows) and making the page look similar on different browsers and in different window sizes.
